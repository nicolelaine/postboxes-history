A gitscraper made of Github actions to track postboxes on OpenStreetMap over time.

[Update - this worked for awhile, but then stopped, and I never could figure out how to get it working again. What mostly happened (I think) is that Node.js needed to be updated, and I waited a while to update it. Once I did, too much time had passed, and the dataset for postboxes had just become to big to save as a scrape. I played around with Git LFS in an attempt to fix this, but never got very far with that either. I then tried paying for some storage to see if I could make it work that way, but also failed there. In short... this is sort of a failed project at this point.

If you DO want to try this out, I suggest breaking down the world and having separate scrapers for each section. That's what I've done with these three repos for post offices, and it's worked much better:

https://github.com/nicolelaine/post-offices-usa-canada-south-america

https://github.com/nicolelaine/post-offices-east-asia-australia

https://github.com/nicolelaine/post-offices-0-90-degrees-longitude

Ideally, I would have liked to keep all the posboxes in one file, but alas! If anyone does know how to fix this or move forward, please reach out. I would love to know how to fix it!]
